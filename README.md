This is a repository for the data and analysis code for the paper "Human Reliance on Machine Learning Models When Performance Feedback is Limited: Heuristics and Risks".

## Repository Structure

* `rawData` contains the profiles of the speed dating tasks used in the experiments, and raw data dumped from the experiment procedure.

* `data` contains the cleaned data including the predictions of tasks and answers to the questionnaire given by subjects.

* `analysis` contains the analysis code implemented by python and R via jupyter notebook and R markdown.

Each file in `data` and `analysis` starting with "experimentOne","experimentTwo", "experimentThree", are each corresponding to the Experiment 1, 2, 3 in the paper.
