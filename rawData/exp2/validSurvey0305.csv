328,50,80,"The model seemed to rely on some of the same factors I did like race and the ratings the person applied.  It seemed to follow the same logic I was using. ,",5,A2X3FSFHV5GHJU
329,80,50,"It can probably read the numbers better than I can. But Sometimes that doesn't always mean anything,",4,A1NRIT5DE3TBID
330,80,80,"I don't know, It just doesn't feel like it accounts for certain common-sense things. Perhaps attractiveness is a dealbreaker, regardless of date quality? The model doesn't seem to account for that.,",5,A2R1TM9CS8OAL

338,50,80,"There were some ratings that I thought did not support what the machine predicted. ,",3,A1JJYY622DGE5L
339,80,80,"On several of the examples, the machine learning model made, what I believed to be, questionable choices. I could not determine the logic of those choices based on the given data, so I do not entirely trust their predictions.,",4,AK1Q45RF8A87Z

341,80,80,"There were times when I felt that the model did not take into account all potential variables. Often times I found the model disagreeing with my prediction. After 20 evaluations I was told that I had been correct 80% of the time. Given that the model had disagreed with me a fair amount of times during those 20 evaluations, I lost some faith in the models ability.,",4,A1BWS5AD2T4NIR

346,50,50,"It gave answers randomly it seemed like it did not look at the info given,",2,A1XQPDHAN5IY0R

348,50,80,"There were multiple times where the person rated their date a 10/10 and the machine learning model said they would not want to see them again which I disagree with.,",1,A1G7GSCKWC9UBC
349,50,50,"Because it just didnt make sense when i looked at the graphs. I dont see how the machine came to those conclusioons according to the results. ,",4,A3SCEKR5XEWDRU
350,80,80,"There were a couple where I disagreed and didn't see a major reason why they wouldn't want to see the date again.,",5,ASUYD8BPYM85M
351,80,80,"I have some trust in it, but it was wrong a decent amount of time so it was just a tool I could do without unless I was really torn on it.,",4,A1YVMDRR9W1LZ1
352,80,50,"This is a model developed by experienced people who have many years of knowledge so I trust it to a degree.,",5,A6KB4VHCZYTY2
353,50,80,"I think sometimes when the ratings were high the machine gave \didn't want to see\ recommendation, which I don't think that is right. So I just pick the option I think is right to me. ,",3,A1MNVFRIMBY6SI
354,80,80,"Sometimes it made no sense especially looking at what was valued by the person and what those values were rated.  I don't thnk an 80% accuracy is all that good to be honest and trusted my own judgement all but one time.  One time it disagreed with me and I was on the fence originally so I changed it over but most of the time I stayed with my judgement even when it disagreed with me.,",4,A3862RIFFUV141
355,50,80,"Based on the factors given to consider I do believe the I was right many of the times and as you said it was right 80%. I trusted myself more.,",5,A2OX8TSRCU6NKD

357,50,50,"For at least 25% of the questions, the machine disagreed with me for a very easy prediction (I was VERY sure of my response) and after that, I could never trust it. However, if I was really on the fence, I might go with it because sometimes it did agree with me when I was pretty sure I was right.,",2,A2UCTX06NM6Y02

362,80,50,"i felt at times it did not represent the numerical data shown in the information giving. section 4 was the main element i used to make the decision in whether the individual wanted to see their date again, at times it was really obvious and the machine still disagreed with numerical confirmation of the data wanting to see their date again.,",3,A2NMLTECRDWFN2

369,50,50,"It was often incorrect, and seemed to ignore how much the participant liked his/her date.,",3,A5PKYZJRK1ZFW

379,50,50,"IF the model was only right half the time throughout the first 20 questions, then chances are high it was not all that accurate for all 31 questions. However, there were a couple of times that I had to look again at what was presented to make a final decision in light of what the model suggested. ,",3,A2W3Q8OCO18HEN
380,80,50,"I feel the machine made mistakes when it was obvious. Mostly we agreed though.,",4,A1Q07N0ONFDIT7

383,50,50,"The learning model often ignored how much the person placed importance upon appearance. If the person did not give the other individual a very high appearance reading, the machine learning model still indicated that he or she would want to see the other person again. If the person did not give the date a very high rating, machine learning model still indicated that they would want to see each other again. I disagreed.,",2,A19TD2J8506A4Y
